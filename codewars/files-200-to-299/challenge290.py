"""
Four-digit palindromes start with [1001,1111,1221,1331,1441,1551,1551,...] and the number at position 2 is 1111.

You will be given two numbers a and b. Your task is to return the a-digit palindrome at position b if the palindromes were arranged in increasing order.

Therefore, palin(4,2) = 1111, because that is the second element of the 4-digit palindrome series.

If you like palindrome Katas, please try: Palindrome integer composition.

Life without primes.
