"""
Write a function named first_non_repeating_letterâ€  that takes a string input,
and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.
For example, if given the input 'stress', the function should return 't', since
the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.
As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character,
but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter. For example,
the input 'sTreSS' should return 'T'.
If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return an empty string ("");
Note: the function is called firstNonRepeatingLetter for historical reasons, but your
function should handle any Unicode character.
